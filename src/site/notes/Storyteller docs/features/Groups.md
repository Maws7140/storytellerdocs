# Groups

Groups represent any collective entity in your story — factions, guilds, families, governments, cults, crews, armies, or corporations. Members can be characters, locations, events, or items.

## Creating a Group

**Command palette:** Storyteller Suite: Create group
**Dashboard:** Groups tab > Create group button

## Group Fields

### Basic Information
- **Name** — the group's display name
- **Type** — faction, guild, family, organization, government, or custom
- **Description** — a free-form markdown field
- **Profile image** — an optional image associated with the group

### Members
Add characters, locations, events, and items to the group's member list. Members appear in the group's dashboard card and can be navigated to directly.

### Faction Details (for faction-type groups)
- **Founding date** — in-world date the group was established
- **Headquarters** — a linked location
- **Leader** — a linked character
- **Ideology / Goals** — free-text fields

### Power and Influence
- **Influence level** — a 1-10 scale
- **Territory** — linked locations the group controls
- **Resources** — a description of the group's assets

### Identity and Symbols
- **Motto**
- **Colors** — the group's symbolic colors
- **Symbol description**

### Inter-Group Relationships
Links to other groups with a relationship type (allied, hostile, neutral, subsidiary, rival) and an optional description.

### Custom Fields
Additional key-value pairs for anything not covered above.

## Viewing All Groups

**Dashboard:** Groups tab
**Command:** Storyteller Suite: View groups

The Groups dashboard tab shows each group as a card with its name, type, member count, and a breakdown of member entity types. Clicking a group opens its edit modal.

## Renaming and Deleting Groups

**Rename:** Storyteller Suite: Rename group — select a group from the list and enter a new name.
**Delete:** Storyteller Suite: Delete group — prompts for confirmation before removing the group and unlinking all members.
