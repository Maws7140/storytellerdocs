# Gallery

The gallery manages images associated with your story — character portraits, location art, item illustrations, and general reference images.

## Opening the Gallery

**Command palette:** Storyteller Suite: Open gallery
**Dashboard:** Gallery tab

## Adding Images

Images can be added to the gallery through the plugin's upload interface. Dragging images directly into Obsidian from your operating system will deposit them in the vault root rather than the gallery folder, making them unsearchable within the plugin. Use the gallery's upload button to ensure images land in the correct folder.

The gallery folder is configured in **Settings > Storyteller Suite > Gallery folder path**.

## Viewing Images

The gallery displays images in a grid. Click any image to view it full-size. Images are shown with their filename as the default title.

## Using Images in Entities

When editing a character, location, or other entity, the portrait or associated image field shows a picker that searches your gallery folder. Select an image from the gallery to link it to the entity.

## Gallery Maintenance

- Renaming an image file in the vault will break links to that image in any entity that references it. To rename an image safely, update the image path in any linked entities afterward.
- The gallery folder path can be changed in settings. Existing images will not be moved automatically.
