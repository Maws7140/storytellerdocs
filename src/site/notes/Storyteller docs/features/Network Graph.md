# Network Graph

The network graph is a visual representation of the relationships between entities in your story. Nodes represent characters, locations, groups, events, and other entities. Edges represent defined relationships between them.

## Opening the Graph

The network graph view is accessible from the dashboard. It renders as an interactive force-directed graph where nodes can be dragged, clusters inspected, and individual entity notes opened.

## What the Graph Shows

Edges are drawn for:
- Character-to-character relationships (defined in the character modal's Relationships section)
- Character-to-group memberships
- Event-to-character involvement
- Event-to-location association
- Location hierarchy (parent-child location links)
- Inter-group relationships

## Interacting with the Graph

- **Drag** nodes to reposition them
- **Click** a node to see a detail panel with the entity's name, type, and key fields
- **Double-click** a node to open the entity's note in Obsidian
- **Scroll** to zoom in and out
- **Filter** by entity type using the controls to hide entity types you don't want to see at a given moment

## Node Count

The status bar at the bottom of the graph shows the total number of nodes and edges currently displayed.
