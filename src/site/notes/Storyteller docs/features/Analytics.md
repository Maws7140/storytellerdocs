# Analytics

The analytics dashboard surfaces writing statistics about your story. It reads from your existing scene and character notes — no separate data entry is required.

## Available Analytics

### Overview
A summary card showing:
- **Total words** — combined word count of all scene notes in the active story
- **Characters** — number of characters tracked
- **Events** — total event count
- **POVs** — number of distinct point-of-view characters used across scenes

### Character Screen Time
A breakdown of how much of your story each character appears in, measured by scene word count. Useful for spotting if a viewpoint character dominates the narrative or if a supporting character has disappeared for too long.

### POV Statistics
Which POV characters are used in which chapters and scenes, and how much page time each receives.

### Event Distribution
A breakdown of events by type or status, showing how your story's events are spread over time.

### Writing Velocity
Word counts over time, based on when scene notes were last modified. Tracks your writing pace across sessions.

### Dialogue Analysis
An estimated breakdown of dialogue versus prose, derived from quotation marks in scene content.

### Pacing Analysis
Examines the ratio of scene to summary, action to reflection, across chapters. Flags chapters that are notably slower or faster than the average.
