# Installation

## From the Obsidian Community Plugin Browser

1. Open Obsidian and go to **Settings > Community plugins**
2. Turn off **Restricted mode** if it is on
3. Click **Browse** and search for **Storyteller Suite**
4. Click **Install**, then **Enable**

## Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Maws7140/obsidian-storyteller-suite/releases)
2. Extract the zip file — it contains `main.js`, `styles.css`, and `manifest.json`
3. Create a folder at `<your vault>/.obsidian/plugins/storyteller-suite/`
4. Copy the three files into that folder
5. Restart Obsidian
6. Go to **Settings > Community plugins** and enable **Storyteller Suite**

## First Launch

On first enable, the plugin creates a `StorytellerSuite/` folder in your vault root. This folder holds all generated entity notes. You can change the folder paths for each entity type in **Settings**.

If you prefer not to have this folder created automatically, go to **Settings > Storyteller Suite** and enable **Prevent auto-folder creation**.

## Requirements

- Obsidian 1.0.12 or later
- Works on desktop and mobile
