# Quick Start

This guide walks you through setting up your first story in under five minutes.

## 1. Create a Story

Open the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`) and run **Storyteller Suite: Create new story**. Give it a name and an optional description. This story acts as the container for all your entities — characters, locations, events, and so on.

Only one story is active at a time. The active story determines which entities appear in lists and which folder paths are used.

## 2. Open the Dashboard

Run **Storyteller Suite: Open dashboard view** from the command palette, or click the Storyteller Suite icon in the left sidebar ribbon. The dashboard is the main hub with tabs for Characters, Locations, Events, Maps, Groups, Scenes, and more.

## 3. Add Your First Character

In the dashboard, go to the **Characters** tab and click **Create character**, or run **Storyteller Suite: Create new character** from the command palette.

Fill in the name and any details you want. The character form has sections for:
- Basic info (name, status, affiliations, age, occupation)
- Portrait image
- Traits and description
- Backstory
- Relationships (links to other characters)
- Group memberships
- Custom fields

Click **Save**. The plugin creates a note for the character in your configured Characters folder.

## 4. Apply a Template (Optional)

If you want a head start with pre-built characters, locations, and relationships, use a story template. Run **Storyteller Suite: Open story template gallery** and pick one (Fantasy Kingdom, Cyberpunk Metropolis, Murder Mystery, and others are included). You can preview what entities the template creates before applying it.

## 5. View the Timeline

Add an event to your story via **Storyteller Suite: Create new event** and then open the timeline with **Storyteller Suite: Open timeline panel**. Events appear on a scrollable timeline. You can add era overlays, multiple tracks, and filter by character or location.
