# Storyteller Suite

Storyteller Suite is an Obsidian plugin for writers who want to manage their story world without leaving their vault. Characters, locations, events, groups, maps, manuscripts, and more — all stored as plain Obsidian notes, all editable directly or through the plugin's interface.

## What it does

- **Characters** — full character sheets with portraits, physical attributes (race, gender, age, height, quirks), relationships, affiliations, custom fields, and an exportable character sheet in six visual themes
- **Locations** — hierarchical location pages with sensory profiles, associated images, child locations, and interactive map placement
- **Events and Timeline** — a visual timeline with multi-track support, era overlays, conflict detection, and timeline forks
- **Groups** — factions, organizations, and other groups with members, relationships, and inter-group dynamics; each group is a linkable vault note
- **Maps** — an interactive Leaflet-based map viewer with entity markers, portal links between maps, and placement mode
- **Compendium** — a world-knowledge database for creatures, plants, materials, potions, and phenomena; supports rarity, danger rating, ecology notes, and circular links to all entity types
- **Manuscript** — chapter and scene management with draft ordering, word count tracking, and manuscript compilation
- **Templates** — six built-in story-world templates (Fantasy Kingdom, Cyberpunk Metropolis, Murder Mystery, and others) plus a full template editor for custom templates
- **Gallery** — image management for portraits and location art
- **Analytics** — writing velocity, character screen time, POV tracking, and pacing analysis
- **Network Graph** — a visual graph of entity relationships
